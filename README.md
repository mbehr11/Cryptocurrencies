Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies
# Cryptocurrencies _Analysis
Working with unsupervised algorithms through pandas and jupyter notebook.
## Overview of Cryptocurrencies _Analysis:
After working with Martha to get more knowledgeable about unsupervised machine learning, youâ€™re ready to take on your first client. You begin working with Martha a top manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. They are considering presenting to their clients are alternate way to invest, through cryptocurrency. However, as this is a new subject, they requested a report be created on how cryptocurrency is doing in the market, and in what different ways can they be classified. The data is a little messy, so you decided to follow unsupervised learning. For grouping the data, we will use the PCA and K-means clustering algorithm. Then finally visualization through 3-D scatter plots.
#### The below pseudocode provided us an outline for the analysis ####
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA 
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Delivery 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
